# Anaplan
During the Anaplan HackerRanks Core Java Codig Test, I had:
1) Several Core Java Questions (there was enough time to double check it in Eclipse
2) 3 Coding tasks
	A) Cup Cake Chocolate Feast, credits go to https://github.com/havelessbemore/hackerrank/blob/master/algorithms/implementation/chocolate-feast.java
	B) Parser Credits go to https://repl.it/@narasakumar/FlippantDualDobermanpinscher
				https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48779489/regular-expression-to-find-a-string-included-between-two-brackets
           Code was quickly addapted
	C) Spread Sheet Notation Convertion, didn't have a time to finish it during the coding Hacker Rank Session due to the lack of testing
	   But found a good source of code at internet that was not able to finalised for the given requirement
