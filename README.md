# Coding_Interview_Preparation
This repository contains of my solutions of the most frequently "Asked To Code" tasks/problems that various companies use to screen the candidates. The goal of my implementation is to be prepared and to have a good collection of ready to copy and paste pieces of code that works well. The "look-up'ed" solution from GeeksForGeeks or another sources will have correct reference/credit on/for it.
