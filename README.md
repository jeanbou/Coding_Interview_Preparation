# Coding_Interview_Preparation
This repository contains of my solutions:

1) The code that was actually submitter or submitted , corrected after to find the solution that works (note: not ideal one)
2) The most frequently "Asked To Code" tasks/problems that various companies use to screen the candidates which I got during the phase "before clicking on link". 

The goal of coding is:
1) To be prepared and to have a good collection of ready to copy and paste pieces of code that works well. 
   The "look-up'ed" solution from GeeksForGeeks, Glassdoors or another sources will be correctly refered.
2) To correct it (even if no good solution submitted), but workout the errors are the best strategy even if it's not actual for certain company anymore
