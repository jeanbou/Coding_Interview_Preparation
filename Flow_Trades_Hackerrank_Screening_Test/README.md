# Flow Trades (Hacker-rank test)
This repository contains of my solutions of the passed screening Hacker Rank tests for Flow Trades
The test for Flow Trades is titled as "Test 2.0 Java" or "Core Java Test 2.0" (something like this)
Problem 1 is exact what you need
Problem 2 is done on 90% (I've taken out of my memorries, but please correct me, there is less to do for you)

About overall 9 question testing.
I think this commentary might be useful that I have extracted from GlassDoors (not mine), I am citing :
"Entretien
hackerrank test: 3 tasks + 6 java questions, 2 tasks are ok, 3rd is useless mathematical computation when you need to google the formula, then video conference call with FT team, talking about your experience and about solutions on hackerrank tasks
Questions d'entretien d'embauche
distributed systems design
"

Enjoy and don't forget to learn and code, that how we are growing up!
